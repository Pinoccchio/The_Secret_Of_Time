# PROLOGUE: "Ang Baúl ng Lihim" (The Chest of Secrets)

## SCENE 1: The Phone Call

**Setting:** Your apartment in Manila, late evening. Rain patters against windows.

### Narrative:

Your phone rings at 11:47 PM. Unknown number.

"Hello?"

Heavy breathing. Then your lola's voice, distant and urgent:

> "Apo... huwag kang mag-alala sa akin. Pero kailangan mong pumunta sa lumang bahay. Ngayon. Hanapin mo ang baúl sa silid ko. Ang anting-anting... ito ang magtuturo sa'yo."
>
> *(Grandchild... don't worry about me. But you need to go to the old house. Now. Find the chest in my room. The amulet... it will teach you.)*

"Lola, what—"

The line goes dead.

Your hands shake. Lola never calls this late. And she sounded... scared?

You grab your jacket. The old ancestral house in the province is two hours away, but something tells you this can't wait until morning.

### Interactive Elements:
- [ ] Phone ringing animation
- [ ] Choice: "Go now" or "Wait until morning" (both lead forward, but different dialogue)
- [ ] Rain sound effects

## SCENE 2: The Ancestral House

**Setting:** Lola's house at midnight. Dark, creaking with age.

### Narrative:

The house is dark when you arrive. The door is unlocked—unusual for Lola.

"Lola?" you call out. No answer.

The house feels different. Heavy. Waiting.

You climb the wooden stairs. Each step creaks. The smell of old wood, moth balls, and something else... incense? Sampaguita flowers?

Lola's room door is ajar. Moonlight streams through the capiz shell windows, casting geometric patterns across the floor.

On her bedside table: a photo of her as a young woman, standing in front of Malacañang Palace, 1986. You've never seen this photo before.

And there, in the corner—the baúl. The old wooden trunk covered in intricate Ifugao carvings. It's glowing faintly.

### Interactive Elements:

## SCENE 3: The Amulet Awakens

**Setting:** Lola's room, the baúl is open.

### Narrative:

You kneel before the baúl. The lock is already open.

Inside: piña cloth napkins embroidered with Baybayin script, old photographs in sepia tones, a pressed sampaguita flower in a glass frame.

And wrapped in red silk—the amulet.

It's copper, shaped like an ancient sun symbol. Baybayin characters spiral around its edge. The moment your fingers touch it, warmth floods through you.

The amulet PULSES.

The room temperature drops. Your breath mists in the air.

A letter unfolds itself on top of the cloth:

### Lola's Letter (handwritten style):

> Mahal kong apo,
>
> Kung binabasa mo na ito, nawawala na ako. Huwag mo akong hanapin—kailangan ko itong gawin para protektahan ka.
>
> *(My dear grandchild,*
>
> *If you're reading this, I'm already gone. Don't look for me—I have to do this to protect you.)*
>
> Ang anting-anting na yan... ito ay naglakbay sa ating pamilya sa loob ng mahigit 400 taon. Ang bawat babae sa ating angkan ay naging tagapag-alaga nito. Ngayon, ikaw na.
>
> *(This amulet... it has traveled through our family for over 400 years. Every woman in our lineage has been its keeper. Now, it's your turn.)*
>
> May mga taong nakakaalam nito. May mga taong papatayin para makuha ito. Hindi dahil sa halaga nito bilang ginto—kundi dahil sa ALAM nito.
>
> *(There are people who know about this. People who would kill to have it. Not because of its value as gold—but because of what it KNOWS.)*
>
> Ang amulet ay may kapangyarihan na ipakita ang nakaraan. Pero hindi basta-basta. Kailangan mong matutunan ang mga code ng bawat panahon. Ang bawat cipher ay susi sa isang katotohanan na matagal nang nakatago.
>
> *(The amulet has the power to show the past. But not easily. You must learn the codes of each era. Each cipher is a key to a truth long hidden.)*
>
> Magsimula ka sa panahon ng ating mga ninuno, bago dumating ang mga mananakop.
>
> *(Start in the time of our ancestors, before the colonizers came.)*
>
> Hanapin ang mensahe na nakaukit sa Baybayin. Ang shift ng tatlong araw ang gagabay sa'yo.
>
> *(Find the message carved in Baybayin. The shift of three days will guide you.)*
>
> At apo... kung nakita mo na ang lahat, kung nalaman mo na ang lihim—ikaw ang pipili kung ano ang gagawin.
>
> *(And grandchild... when you've seen everything, when you've learned the secret—you will choose what to do with it.)*
>
> Ang tunay na yaman ay nasa alaala. Ang tunay na kapangyarihan ay nasa pagpili.
>
> *(True wealth is in memory. True power is in choice.)*
>
> Mahal na mahal kita. Ingat ka palagi.
>
> *(I love you so much. Always be careful.)*
>
> — Your Lola
>
> P.S. Tandaan: Ang hindi marunong lumingon sa pinanggalingan ay hindi makararating sa paroroonan.
>
> *(Remember: Those who do not look back to where they came from will not reach their destination.)*

The room spins. Colors blur—blue, green, gold, red.

You hear sounds: waves crashing, seagulls crying, people shouting in old Tagalog, wooden ships creaking...

Your stomach lurches. You're falling—

No.

You're traveling.

Through TIME itself.

The world fractures into a thousand pieces of light, then reforms...

# CHAPTER 1: "Sa Panahon ng Ginto" (In the Time of Gold)

**ERA:** Pre-Colonial Philippines, circa 1450 CE

**LOCATION:** Coastal barangay in Manila Bay area

**CIPHER TYPE:** Caesar Cipher (Shift by 3)

**EMOTIONAL THEME:** Wonder and Discovery

---

## SCENE 1: Arrival in Paradise

**Setting:** Early morning, bustling trading port

### Narrative:

You land hard on packed earth.

Your modern clothes are gone. You're wearing a woven bahag (loincloth) and a colorful patadyong (wraparound skirt). Gold bangles circle your wrists—heavy, real, ancient.

The air is different. Cleaner. The smell of salt, fresh fish, burning wood, and something sweet—ripe mangoes?

You're standing in the middle of a thriving settlement.

Bahay kubo houses with nipa roofs line curved pathways. Smoke rises from cooking fires. Women pound palay (rice) in wooden mortars, their rhythmic thudding creating a hypnotic beat.

The harbor is alive with activity:

Three massive balangay boats are docked, their colorful sails furled. Traders unload porcelain jars from China, silk from India, spices from Moluccas. Gold jewelry gleams in the morning sun—not from Spanish galleons, but crafted by Filipino goldsmiths whose work rivals any in Asia.

Children run past you laughing, playing with wooden tops. They don't seem surprised by your presence.

You touch the amulet beneath your clothes. It's warm, pulsing in rhythm with your heartbeat.

"Baguhan ka dito, hindi ba?"

*(You're new here, aren't you?)*

You turn.

### Interactive Elements:
- [ ] Click around: examine boats, goods, people
- [ ] Ambient sounds: waves, seagulls, rhythmic pounding, children laughing
- [ ] Hover over items to learn about pre-colonial trade

## SCENE 2: The Babaylan's Warning

**Setting:** Same location, mysterious spiritual leader approaches

### Narrative:

An old woman stands before you. But "old" doesn't capture it—she's timeless. Her eyes hold centuries.

She wears layers of intricately woven cloth. Gold necklaces cascade down her chest. Tattoos spiral up her arms—symbols you don't recognize but somehow feel you should.

Her wooden staff is carved with the same patterns as your amulet.

"Babaylan," someone whispers with respect as people make way for her.

She studies you with unsettling intensity, then touches the amulet through your clothing. Her eyes widen.

"Ikaw ang tagapagmana," she says, her voice layered with power.
*(You are the inheritor.)*

"Ang inyong lola... nakita ko siya sa aking mga panaginip. Sinabi niya na darating ka."
*(Your grandmother... I saw her in my dreams. She said you would come.)*

Your breath catches. "You saw her? Where is she?"

The babaylan's expression darkens. "Hindi sa ngayon. Hindi sa lugar na ito."
*(Not in now. Not in this place.)*

She glances toward the harbor. Her grip on your arm tightens.

"May mga taong dumating kahapon. Dayuhan. Pero hindi normal na mga mangangalakal. Ang kanilang mga mata... hinahanap nila ang may hawak ng amulet."

*(People came yesterday. Foreigners. But not normal traders. Their eyes... they're searching for the one who carries the amulet.)*

"Ang sabi ng inyong lola, kailangan mong matutunan ang unang code. Ang pinakasimple, ngunit ang pundasyon ng lahat."

*(Your grandmother said, you must learn the first code. The simplest, but the foundation of all.)*

She presses a piece of polished bark into your hands. Symbols are carved deep into the wood—not Baybayin, but the alphabet you know, yet... shifted?

"Ang shift ng tatlong araw," she whispers. "Tulad ng aming pagbibilang ng mga araw hanggang sa trading moon."

*(The shift of three days. Like how we count the days until the trading moon.)*

Behind her, you see them: three men in strange clothes, neither fully Spanish nor indigenous. They're watching the crowd, searching.

One points toward you.

The babaylan sees them too. "Mabilis. Decipher the message. Kapag nalutas mo, poprotektahan ka ng amulet at ipapadala ka sa susunod na panahon."

*(Quick. Decipher the message. When you solve it, the amulet will protect you and send you to the next time.)*

"Who are they?" you ask.

"Ang mga naghahabol sa lihim. Ang mga ayaw lumingon sa nakaraan ngunit gustong kontrolin ang hinaharap."

*(The ones chasing the secret. Those who refuse to look at the past but want to control the future.)*

"Ngayon. Basahin mo. Bilisan mo!"
*(Now. Read it. Hurry!)*

### Interactive Elements:
- [ ] Character portraits for Babaylan (animated, expressive)
- [ ] Tension music builds as pursuers get closer
- [ ] Timer starts (soft pressure, not game-over)

## SCENE 4: Escape and Revelation

### Narrative:

The final letter clicks into place. The message glows:

**"THE GOLD OF MANILA IS HIDDEN IN THE CENTRAL MARKET UNDER THE STONE WITH THREE SUNS"**

The babaylan smiles. "Matalino ka, tulad ng iyong lola."
*(You're clever, like your grandmother.)*

The pursuers are running now, pushing through the crowd.

"Teka!" you say. "The gold of Manila? I need to find it?"
*(Wait!)*

The babaylan shakes her head. "Hindi. The message is not the treasure. Ang PAG-UNAWA ang yaman."

*(No. The message is not the treasure. UNDERSTANDING is the wealth.)*

"Your grandmother hid something in each time period. Not gold. Not jewels. MEMORIES. TRUTH. Ang mga kuwento na kinalimutan, o sinadyang nakalimutan."

*(MEMORIES. TRUTH. The stories that were forgotten, or deliberately forgotten.)*

The amulet burns hot against your chest.

"The central market stone..." the babaylan points to a large carved stone in the market center. Three suns—the ancient symbol of power—are etched into it.

"Go. Touch it. Understand."

You run, the pursuers shouting behind you.

Your hand hits the stone.

**FLASH—**

A vision:

This same market, but centuries later. Burned. Destroyed. Spanish soldiers dragging away gold. The babaylan standing here, watching, weeping. But she's hiding something under this very stone—a clay jar sealed with wax.

**FLASH—**

You're back. The pursuers are meters away.

The babaylan raises her staff. The air shimmers.

"Ang susunod na panahon ay mas madilim. Mas mapanganib. Pero kailangan mong makita. Handa ka na ba?"

*(The next time period is darker. More dangerous. But you must see it. Are you ready?)*

"I—"

Too late. The amulet explodes with light.

The world RIPS apart.

You hear the babaylan's last words echoing:

"Alalahanin: Ang bawat code ay isang kasaysayan. Ang bawat kasaysayan ay isang code na kailangang basahin ng mga susunod na henerasyon."

*(Remember: Every code is a history. Every history is a code that must be read by the next generations.)*

# MEMORY INTERLUDE: Between Chapter 1 and 2

### Narrative:

In the space between times, you float.

Images flash:

Your lola's hands, weathered but gentle, teaching you to weave when you were seven.

"Tignan mo, apo," she said. "Bawat thread ay may kuwento. Bawat pattern ay code."
*(Look, grandchild. Every thread has a story. Every pattern is code.)*

You didn't understand then.

Now you do.

The amulet shows you another memory—not yours. Lola's.

She's young, your age, standing in this same market in 1945. Smoke rises from bombed-out buildings. She's handing a coded message to a guerrilla fighter.

The message uses... a Vigenère cipher. The keyword: KALAYAAN (Freedom).

"Lola?" you whisper into the void. "You were a codebreaker?"

Her voice echoes from everywhere and nowhere:

"We all were, apo. Ang bawat Pilipino na lumaban ay naging codebreaker sa kanilang sariling paraan. Hindi lang ng mga code sa papel—kundi ng code ng pang-aapi, ng injustice, ng takot."

*(We all were, grandchild. Every Filipino who fought became a codebreaker in their own way. Not just of codes on paper—but the codes of oppression, of injustice, of fear.)*

"Keep going. The next cipher is harder. But you're ready."

The void shatters—

# CHAPTER 2: "Ang Lihim ng Kalayaan" (The Secret of Freedom)

**ERA:** Philippine Revolution, 1896

**LOCATION:** Hidden Katipunan meeting place, outskirts of Manila

**CIPHER TYPE:** Vigenère Cipher (Keyword: KALAYAAN)

**EMOTIONAL THEME:** Courage and Sacrifice

---

## SCENE 1: Night of the Revolution

**Setting:** Dark nipa hut, secret meeting in progress

### Narrative:

You land in darkness.

For a moment, you panic—then you realize you're inside a structure. Nipa walls. Bamboo floor. The smell of burning coconut oil from a small lamp.

Voices. Urgent. Whispering.

Your eyes adjust. You're in a small hut. About twenty people crowd inside—men and women, young and old. They wear simple clothing, barong and saya, but each has a red scarf or band somewhere on their person.

On the wall: A triangle with three K's. KKK—Kataastaasan, Kagalanggalangang Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan. *(Highest, Most Respected Society of Children of the Nation)*.

The Katipunan. The secret society that launched the Philippine Revolution against Spain.

This is 1896. The revolution is about to begin.

A man in the center is speaking. You recognize him from history books—Andrés Bonifacio, the Supremo. His eyes burn with passion.

"Mga kapatid," he says, his voice low but powerful, "dumating na ang panahon. Hindi na tayo pwedeng manahimik. Ang kalayaan ay hindi ibibigay—kinukuha natin."

*(Brothers and sisters, the time has come. We can no longer stay silent. Freedom is not given—we take it.)*

The room murmurs agreement.

Then someone notices you.

"Sino ka?" *(Who are you?)*

Everyone turns. Hands go to hidden weapons—bolos, daggers.

The amulet pulses under your shirt.

Bonifacio studies you. His gaze is piercing, intelligent. "Bagong mukha. Pero ang mata mo... nakita mo na ang ating hinaharap."

*(New face. But your eyes... you've seen our future.)*

He sees the shape of the amulet through your clothing. His expression changes.

"Ipakita mo."
*(Show it.)*

Hesitantly, you pull out the amulet. It gleams in the lamplight.

The room gasps. An old woman pushes forward—another babaylan, you realize. Different from the one before, but connected somehow.

"Ang tagapagmana!" she breathes. "Sinabi ng aking ninuno na darating ka. Ang daladalang ng kodigo."

*(The inheritor! My ancestor said you would come. The carrier of the codes.)*

Bonifacio nods slowly. "Kung totoo yan, mayroon kaming mensahe para sa'yo. O dapat sabihin—para sa kinabukasan. Para sa mga susunod."

*(If that's true, we have a message for you. Or should I say—for the future. For those who come after.)*

He pulls out a piece of paper, carefully folded and sealed with red wax bearing the Katipunan symbol.

"Ginawa namin ang code na ito. Ang susi nito ay ang salitang pinakamamahal namin—ang dahilan ng aming pakikibaka."

*(We made this code. Its key is the word most precious to us—the reason for our struggle.)*

On the wall behind him, painted in red: **KALAYAAN** *(FREEDOM)*.

## SCENE 2: The Spy's Threat

### Narrative:

Just as Bonifacio hands you the paper, the door bursts open.

A man stumbles in, bleeding from his shoulder.

"Guardia Civil! Alam nila ang lokasyon! Paparating na!"
*(Civil Guard! They know the location! They're coming!)*

Chaos. People rush to hide documents, weapons.

Bonifacio grabs your arm. "Walang oras. Kailangan mong decipher yan ngayon. Ang mensahe na yan... mahalaga sa kinabukasan ng Pilipinas."

*(No time. You need to decipher it now. That message... is important for the Philippines' future.)*

"Pero—"
*(But—)*

"Ang KALAYAAN ang susi. Hindi lang sa code. Sa lahat."
*(FREEDOM is the key. Not just to the code. To everything.)*

Outside, you hear boots marching. Shouts in Spanish.

"Alam ng inyong lola ang tungkol dito," the babaylan says, pressing something into your palm—a small bone carved with symbols. "Ito ang kanyang iniwan dito noong siya ay bumisita."

*(Your grandmother knows about this. This is what she left here when she visited.)*

"She was here?!"

"Ang amulet ay nagpapahintulot ng paglalakbay. Ang bawat guardian ay bumisita sa bawat panahon, nag-iiwan ng mga palatandaan, nag-aayos ng timeline."

*(The amulet allows travel. Every guardian has visited every era, leaving signs, arranging the timeline.)*

The door shudders. Someone's trying to break it down.

Bonifacio and his people prepare to fight. To die if necessary.

"Mabilis!" he shouts at you. "Decipher it! When you finish, the amulet will take you to safety!"

The coded message unfolds in your shaking hands...

## SCENE 4: The Cost of Freedom

### Narrative:

The final word appears: **"BEFORE"**

The complete message glows:

**"FIGHT FOR FREEDOM IN THE REVOLUTION. NEVER FORGET THE SACRIFICE OF THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE."**

The door breaks open.

Spanish soldiers pour in.

But time slows down.

The amulet burns white-hot.

Bonifacio looks at you one last time. He's not afraid. He's proud.

"Tandaan mo kami. Sabihin mo sa kinabukasan na hindi kami nag-alinlangan."
*(Remember us. Tell the future that we did not hesitate.)*

The babaylan touches your forehead. "Ang susunod na code ay mas kumplikado. Pero mas kaunting dugo ang nabuhos. Magpapakatatag ka."

*(The next code is more complicated. But less blood was spilled. Be strong.)*

"Wait! What happens to you? To them?"

"Ang kasaysayan ay nasusulat na. Pero ang paraan kung paano natin ito naalala—yan ang lumalaban ka."

*(History is already written. But the way we remember it—that's what you're fighting for.)*

The world EXPLODES in red and gold—

Gunfire. Screaming. Steel clashing.

But you're already gone—

Falling through time—

Through the smoke of burning Manila—

Through the tears of widows—

Through the blood of martyrs—

And you understand:

The code wasn't just in the message. It was in their courage. Their willingness to die for something bigger than themselves.

Your lola's voice echoes:

"Ang bawat code ay nangangailangan ng sacrifice. Ang pagbabasa ng kasaysayan ay hindi libre. Binabayaran ito ng mga sumunod sa pag-aalala at pag-unawa."

*(Every code requires sacrifice. Reading history is not free. It is paid for by those who come after with remembrance and understanding.)*

# MEMORY INTERLUDE: Between Chapter 2 and 3

### Narrative:

Floating again. But this time, the void is filled with red.

Blood? No. Roses. Sampaguita. The flowers laid on heroes' graves.

You see Lola again, but older now. 1980s. She's at the Bonifacio Monument, laying flowers.

A young version of you—maybe 5 years old—is holding her hand.

"Lola, sino siya?" young-you asks, pointing at the statue.
*(Lola, who is he?)*

"Isang bayani. Pero mas importante—isang tao. Tulad mo at ko. Pero pumili siyang lumaban."

*(A hero. But more importantly—a person. Like you and me. But he chose to fight.)*

"Para saan?" young-you asks.
*(For what?)*

Lola kneels, looks into your young eyes:

"Para sa kalayaan mo. Para sa karapatang pumili mo. Para sa boses mo."
*(For your freedom. For your right to choose. For your voice.)*

The memory shifts.

Now you see Lola in 1945. She's in the mountains with guerrillas. She's younger than you are now—maybe 19.

She's creating a code. A Playfair cipher. The keyword: BATAAN.

"Kailangan natin ng cipher na hindi madaling basahin ng mga Hapon," she tells a guerrilla commander. "Pero madaling maintindihan ng ating mga kasama."

*(We need a cipher that's not easy for the Japanese to read. But easy for our comrades to understand.)*

The commander nods. "Matalino ka, Maria."

Maria. That was her first name.

You never asked about her past.

# CHAPTER 3: "Ang Dilim Bago ang Liwanag" (The Darkness Before the Light)

**ERA:** World War II, February 1945 — Liberation of Manila

**LOCATION:** Guerrilla camp in the Sierra Madre mountains, Luzon

**CIPHER TYPE:** Playfair Cipher (Keyword: BATAAN)

**EMOTIONAL THEME:** Sacrifice and Unexpected Connection

---

## SCENE 1: The Mountain Camp

**Setting:** Dense jungle, hidden guerrilla encampment, pre-dawn

### Narrative:

You crash through leaves and vines, landing hard on muddy ground.

The air is thick. Humid. Heavy with the smell of rotting vegetation, wood smoke, and something else—gunpowder?

Distant thunder. No—not thunder. Artillery fire. Bombs.

You're in a jungle. Mountains rise around you, shrouded in mist. Dawn is just breaking, painting the sky in bruised purples and angry reds.

Voices. Filipino. English. American accents?

You push through the undergrowth and find yourself at the edge of a camp.

Makeshift tents of woven palm leaves. Foxholes dug into the hillside. Men and women in ragged clothes, some wearing torn American military uniforms, others in peasant clothing. All armed—rifles, bolos, grenades.

A radio crackles with static somewhere. You catch fragments:
*"...MacArthur's forces advancing... Manila under heavy fire... Japanese retreating but destroying everything..."*

This is 1945. The liberation of the Philippines. The bloodiest urban battle of the Pacific War is happening right now in Manila.

A hand grabs your shoulder. You spin around.

A young woman stands before you. She can't be older than nineteen. Her hair is cropped short, practical. Her eyes are fierce but tired—the eyes of someone who has seen too much death.

She wears a man's military shirt, too big for her frame, and carries a bolo at her hip. A scar runs along her left forearm—fresh, barely healed.

Something about her face is familiar. The shape of her jaw. The way she tilts her head when studying you.

But you can't place it.

"Sino ka?" she demands, hand on her bolo. "Paano ka nakarating dito? Walang dumadaan sa aming linya na hindi namin alam."

*(Who are you? How did you get here? No one passes our line without us knowing.)*

## SCENE 2: The Codebreaker

**Setting:** Same location, tense confrontation

### Narrative:

Before you can answer, the amulet pulses beneath your shirt.

The young woman's eyes lock onto the glow. Her expression shifts—suspicion becomes shock, then something else. Recognition?

"Saan mo nakuha yan?" she whispers, voice changed completely.
*(Where did you get that?)*

"It's... a family heirloom. My lola—"

"Ipakita mo." Her voice is urgent now, almost desperate.
*(Show it.)*

You pull out the amulet. It gleams in the early morning light.

The young woman staggers back as if struck. Her hand goes to her own chest, where—you notice now—a similar shape hangs beneath her shirt.

"Hindi... hindi pwede..." she breathes.
*(No... it can't be...)*

She pulls out her own pendant. It's not an amulet—it's a locket. Copper, with Baybayin engravings. The same spiral pattern.

"Saan—KAILAN—ka galing?" she asks, and the question makes no sense until you realize: she's asking WHEN, not just WHERE.
*(Where—WHEN—are you from?)*

She knows. Somehow, she knows about time travel.

"The future," you manage. "2024."

She closes her eyes. Takes a breath. When she opens them, there are tears she's fighting back.

"Dumating ka na nga." A sad smile crosses her face.
*(You finally came.)*

"I'm Maria. Maria Santos." She extends her hand. "At kung tama ang aking suspetsa... magkikita pa tayo. Pero hindi mo pa ako makikilala noon."

*(And if my suspicion is correct... we'll meet again. But you won't recognize me then.)*

Before you can ask what she means, a man rushes over—American, tall, wearing guerrilla clothing.

"Maria! We intercepted a Japanese transmission. It's encrypted. We need your skills."

Maria nods, all business now. She turns to you.

"Ikaw. Sumama ka. Kung talagang ikaw ang tagapagmana, kailangan mong makita ito."

*(You. Come with me. If you're truly the inheritor, you need to see this.)*

## SCENE 3: The War Room

**Setting:** Underground bunker, maps and radio equipment

### Narrative:

Maria leads you into a hidden bunker dug into the mountainside.

Oil lamps cast flickering shadows on earthen walls reinforced with bamboo. Maps cover every surface—Manila, Bataan, Corregidor. Red pins mark Japanese positions. Blue pins mark Allied advances.

A Filipino commander and two American officers huddle over a table.

"Maria," the commander says. "The message?"

Maria takes a crumpled paper from a radio operator. Her eyes scan the encrypted text.

"Playfair cipher," she says immediately. "Japanese military has been using it for local communications. Mas mabilis kaysa sa kanilang Purple machine pero mas madaling basahin—kung alam mo ang keyword."

*(Faster than their Purple machine but easier to read—if you know the keyword.)*

She looks at you. "Our intelligence says they're using location-based keywords. This transmission came from their unit that fought at..."

"Bataan," the American officer finishes. "The death march. Those bastards would use that."

Maria's jaw tightens. You see pain flash across her face.

"Ang tatay ko... namatay sa Bataan Death March," she says quietly.
*(My father... died in the Bataan Death March.)*

Silence.

Then she straightens. "Kaya gagamitin ko ang salitang yan para talunin sila. BATAAN."

*(So I'll use that word to defeat them. BATAAN.)*

She turns to you. "Ang Playfair cipher ay gumagamit ng pairs ng letters. Tulad ng kung paano tayo lumalaban—hindi kailanman mag-isa. Palaging magkasama."

*(The Playfair cipher uses pairs of letters. Like how we fight—never alone. Always together.)*

She hands you the intercepted message.

"Marunong ka ba? O kailangan kitang turuan?"
*(Do you know how? Or do I need to teach you?)*

Distant explosions rock the bunker. Dust falls from the ceiling.

The commander shouts: "We need that message decoded NOW! Lives depend on it!"

Maria looks at you with those familiar eyes.

"Sabay nating gawin. Magkasama."
*(Let's do it together. As companions.)*

## SCENE 5: The Revelation

### Narrative:

The final pair decrypts. The message glows:

**"THE ENEMY WILL RETREAT THROUGH LUNETA. AMBUSH AT DAWN."**

The commander snatches the paper. "Luneta! We can cut them off!"

He rushes out, shouting orders. The American officers follow.

You're alone with Maria.

She's staring at you with an expression you can't read.

"Magaling," she says softly. "Mabilis kang matuto."
*(Well done. You learn fast.)*

"Maria... you said we'll meet again. What did you mean?"

She reaches into her pocket and pulls out a photograph. Faded, creased from being carried everywhere.

It shows a baby wrapped in a blanket embroidered with Baybayin script.

"Ang anak ng anak ko," she says. "Ipinanganak noong 1975. Thirty years from now para sa akin. Pero para sa'yo..."

*(My grandchild. Born in 1975. Thirty years from now for me. But for you...)*

The world tilts.

"Hindi pa ako sigurado noon," Maria continues, tears finally falling. "Pero ngayon... nakikita ko na. Ang mata mo. Ang paraan ng pagtingin mo sa mundo. Ang tapang at takot na magkasama. Kilala kita."

*(I wasn't sure before. But now... I see it. Your eyes. The way you look at the world. The courage and fear together. I know you.)*

"Lola?" The word escapes you before you can stop it.

Maria—young Maria—your LOLA—smiles through her tears.

"Hindi mo pa ako lola. Nineteen pa lang ako. Pero isang araw..."
*(I'm not your lola yet. I'm only nineteen. But one day...)*

She pulls you into a fierce embrace. She smells like gunpowder, jungle mud, and something floral—sampaguita. The same perfume she'll wear sixty years from now.

"Kaya pala alam mo ang lahat," you whisper. "Kaya mo alam ang mga cipher, ang mga panahon, ang mga—"

*(So that's why you know everything. Why you know the ciphers, the eras, the—)*

"Dahil nakilala na kita." She pulls back, holding your face in her calloused hands. "At dahil isang araw, magtuturo ako sa'yo ng mga patterns kapag bata ka pa. Hindi mo maalala. Pero ang iyong subconscious... alam nito."

*(Because I already met you. And because one day, I'll teach you patterns when you're young. You won't remember. But your subconscious... knows.)*

The amulet FLARES.

"Hindi pa tayo tapos," Maria says quickly. "Dalawa pang panahon. Dalawa pang cipher. At ang pinakamahirap na pagpili sa dulo."

*(We're not done yet. Two more eras. Two more ciphers. And the hardest choice at the end.)*

"Lola—Maria—where are you NOW? In my time? Why did you disappear?"

Her face shadows. "May mga bagay na hindi ko pa pwedeng sabihin. Ang timeline... delikado. Pero malalaman mo. Sa EDSA. Doon mo malalaman ang lahat."

*(There are things I can't tell you yet. The timeline... is delicate. But you'll know. At EDSA. That's where you'll learn everything.)*

She presses something into your palm. The carved bone from earlier—but now you see it's part of a set. One half.

"Hanapin ang kalahati. Nasa panahon ng kadiliman—ang Martial Law. Ang babae na magbibigay nito sa'yo... protektahan mo siya."

*(Find the other half. It's in the time of darkness—Martial Law. The woman who gives it to you... protect her.)*

"Sino siya?"
*(Who is she?)*

Maria smiles sadly. "Ako rin. Mas matanda. Mas pagod. Pero lumalaban pa rin."

*(Me too. Older. More tired. But still fighting.)*

The world begins to tear apart.

"LOLA!"

"Mahal kita, apo. Palagi. Sa lahat ng panahon."
*(I love you, grandchild. Always. In all times.)*

Everything goes WHITE—

# MEMORY INTERLUDE: Between Chapter 3 and 4

### Narrative:

You fall through time, but you're not alone.

Fragments of Maria's life flash around you:

**FLASH—**
1946. Maria receiving a medal for her service. She's smiling, but her eyes are haunted.

**FLASH—**
1952. A wedding. Maria in a simple white dress, marrying a man with kind eyes. Your lolo. You never met him—he died before you were born.

**FLASH—**
1960. Maria holding a baby—your mother—singing a kundiman lullaby.

**FLASH—**
1972. Television static. Marcos declaring Martial Law. Maria's face hardening with familiar determination.

**FLASH—**
1975. Maria, now in her late forties, holding another baby. You.

Her voice whispers through the visions:

"Ang buhay ko ay naging code na rin, apo. Encrypted sa iba't ibang panahon. Pero ikaw—ikaw ang key na nag-uugnay sa lahat."

*(My life became a code too, grandchild. Encrypted across different eras. But you—you are the key that connects everything.)*

"Ang susunod na panahon ay ang pinakamadilim. Martial Law. Censorship. Takot. Pero kahit sa dilim, may mga nag-iilaw."

*(The next era is the darkest. Martial Law. Censorship. Fear. But even in darkness, there are those who shine.)*

"Hanapin mo ang mga estudyante. Hanapin mo ang aking younger self. At matuto kang magbasa sa pagitan ng mga linya—dahil sa panahong iyon, ang katotohanan ay palaging nakatago."

*(Find the students. Find my younger self. And learn to read between the lines—because in that time, truth was always hidden.)*

You feel yourself PULLED forward through the decades—

1973... 1975... 1978... 1980... 1983—

The world SNAPS into focus.

# CHAPTER 4: "Ang Tinig sa Kadiliman" (The Voice in the Darkness)

**ERA:** Martial Law, August 1983 — Days after Ninoy Aquino's assassination

**LOCATION:** University of the Philippines Diliman campus

**CIPHER TYPE:** Rail Fence Cipher (3 Rails)

**EMOTIONAL THEME:** Resistance and Hidden Truth

---

## SCENE 1: Campus Under Siege

**Setting:** UP Diliman, night, heavy atmosphere of fear and defiance

### Narrative:

You land on grass. Soft. Damp.

The air is different again—polluted, heavy, electric with tension.

You're on a university campus. Art Deco buildings. Sprawling lawns. Acacia trees casting long shadows under harsh streetlights.

But something is wrong.

Military trucks line the roads. Soldiers patrol in pairs, rifles ready. Helicopters thrum in the distance, searchlights sweeping across buildings.

Students hurry past in groups, speaking in hushed voices. Some wear black armbands.

On a wall, someone has spray-painted: **"NINOY HINDI KA NAG-IISA"**
*(Ninoy, you are not alone)*

Below it, soldiers are painting over the words. But more appear on another wall. And another.

This is August 1983. Days after Senator Ninoy Aquino was assassinated on the tarmac of Manila International Airport.

The Philippines is about to wake up.

A hand grabs your arm and pulls you into the shadows.

"Ano ba?! Gusto mong madampot?! Bawal ang curfew violations!"
*(What are you doing?! Do you want to get arrested?! Curfew violations are prohibited!)*

It's a young woman. Student. Maybe early twenties. She wears a simple shirt and jeans, but her eyes burn with the same fire you saw in Maria.

Wait.

The shape of her face. The way she holds herself. The scar on her left forearm—older now, faded, but unmistakable.

Maria. In her fifties. But somehow still fierce. Still fighting.

"Lola?" you whisper.

Her eyes widen. She pulls you deeper into the shadows, behind a building.

"Paano mo—" she stops. Stares at the amulet glowing beneath your shirt. Understanding dawns.

"Ah. Nandito ka na pala sa panahong ito."
*(Ah. So you're here in this time now.)*

She looks older than in 1945—thirty-eight years older—but her spirit is unchanged. Gray streaks her hair. Lines mark her face. But her eyes are the same.

"Hindi kita masyado nakausap nung huli," she says with a slight smile. "Sobrang bilis ng mga pangyayari noon sa bundok."

*(I didn't get to talk to you much last time. Things moved so fast in the mountains.)*

"Lola, ang daming tanong ko—"

She raises a hand. "Alam ko. Pero ngayon—hindi oras para sa tanong. May ginagawa akong importante. At kailangan mo akong tulungan."

*(I know. But now—it's not time for questions. I'm doing something important. And I need your help.)*

## SCENE 2: The Underground Network

**Setting:** Hidden basement room, student activists working

### Narrative:

Maria leads you through winding paths, avoiding patrols, until you reach an unassuming building.

She knocks—three short, two long, one short.

A slot opens. Eyes peer out. A whispered password exchange you can't quite hear.

The door opens.

Inside: chaos organized into purpose.

Students operate mimeograph machines, cranking out newsletters. Others type on ancient typewriters. Radio equipment crackles in a corner. Stacks of paper everywhere—underground newspapers, pamphlets, poems.

A banner on the wall: **"ANG BAYAN KONG PILIPINAS"** *(My Country, the Philippines)* with a clenched fist.

"Tita Maria!" A young man rushes over. Early twenties, glasses, ink-stained fingers. "Dumating na yung contact natin sa Malacañang. May leak."

*(The contact from Malacañang arrived. There's a leak.)*

Maria's expression sharpens. "Ano?"

"Listahan. Ng mga susunod na i-a-aresto. Mga student leaders. Mga journalist. Mga—" He glances at you suspiciously.

*(A list. Of the next people to be arrested. Student leaders. Journalists. Some—)*

"Siya ay mapagkakatiwalaan," Maria says firmly. "Ano pa?"
*(This one can be trusted. What else?)*

"Naka-encrypt ang listahan. Para kung ma-intercept, hindi nila mabasa."

*(The list is encrypted. So if it's intercepted, they can't read it.)*

Maria nods slowly. "Anong klaseng cipher?"

"Hindi namin alam. Pero may pattern. Parang zigzag?"

Maria's eyes light up. She turns to you.

"Rail Fence. Ginamit namin yan noon sa WWII para sa mga mensaheng mabilis. Ang mensahe ay sinusulat sa zigzag pattern, tapos binabasa sa mga linya."

*(Rail Fence. We used it in WWII for quick messages. The message is written in zigzag pattern, then read in rows.)*

She puts a hand on your shoulder.

"Kaya mo 'to. Nakita kong ginawa mo ang Playfair sa ilalim ng pressure. Ito—mas madali. Pero mas mataas ang stakes."

*(You can do this. I saw you do Playfair under pressure. This—is easier. But the stakes are higher.)*

"Kung hindi natin ma-decrypt yan ngayong gabi, bukas—mawawala ang mga estudyanteng nasa listahan. 'Salvaging' ang tawag nila. Pero alam natin kung ano talaga."

*(If we don't decrypt it tonight, tomorrow—the students on that list will disappear. They call it 'salvaging.' But we know what it really means.)*

She hands you the encrypted message.

"Tatlong antas. Tatlong linya. Basahin mo ang nasa pagitan."
*(Three levels. Three lines. Read what's in between.)*

## SCENE 4: The Warning and the Prophecy

### Narrative:

The final letter clicks into place:

**"PEOPLE POWER INHERENT FREEDOM"**

Maria stares at the decrypted message. Her face pales.

"Hindi ito listahan," she whispers.
*(This isn't a list.)*

"Tita Maria?" the young man asks nervously.

"Ito ay... mensahe. Galing sa hinaharap? O—" She looks at you.
*(This is... a message. From the future? Or—)*

You understand. "Lola—the message ISN'T from Malacañang. It's from YOU. You planted it. For this moment."

Maria slowly nods. "Minsan nakakalimutan ko kung ano ang ginawa ko sa ibang timeline. Pero ito... ito ang prophecy. Ang babala."

*(Sometimes I forget what I did in other timelines. But this... this is the prophecy. The warning.)*

"People Power," you say. "EDSA. 1986. Three years from now."

"Tatlong taon." Maria closes her eyes. "Tatlong taon pa ng pakikipaglaban. Tatlong taon pa ng takot. Pero pagkatapos..."

*(Three years. Three more years of fighting. Three more years of fear. But after...)*

She opens her eyes. They're wet with tears—but also shining with hope.

"Ang katotohanan ay palaging lumalabas. Kahit i-encrypt mo, kahit itago mo, kahit patayin mo ang mga taong nakakaalam—ang katotohanan ay may sariling buhay."

*(Truth always emerges. Even if you encrypt it, even if you hide it, even if you kill the people who know—truth has its own life.)*

She reaches into her pocket and pulls out something.

The other half of the carved bone.

"Ito ang natirang kalahati. Kapag pinagsama mo—"
*(This is the remaining half. When you put them together—)*

You pull out your piece. They fit perfectly.

The bone glows. Symbols appear—a map. Coordinates. And a date: **February 22, 1986.**

"EDSA," Maria breathes. "Doon ang huling cipher. At doon—doon mo malalaman ang buong katotohanan."

*(EDSA. That's where the final cipher is. And there—there you'll learn the whole truth.)*

She cups your face in her hands. Older now than in 1945, but her touch is the same.

"Malapit na tayong matapos, apo. Isang panahon na lang. Pero ang huling hakbang—iyon ang pinakamahirap."

*(We're almost done, grandchild. One more era. But the final step—that's the hardest.)*

"Bakit?"

"Dahil sa dulo... ikaw ang pipili. Hindi ako. Hindi ang amulet. IKAW."

*(Because at the end... you will choose. Not me. Not the amulet. YOU.)*

The amulet BLAZES.

But this time, Maria grabs your hand.

"Sabay tayo."
*(We go together.)*

The world TEARS open—

And for the first time, you travel through time holding your grandmother's hand.

# MEMORY INTERLUDE: Between Chapter 4 and 5

### Narrative:

You travel through time together, and Maria shows you things.

**FLASH—**
The years between. Her life.

1955: Opening a small sari-sari store with your lolo's savings.
1963: Your mother's first day of school. Maria crying happy tears.
1972: Watching Marcos on TV. Knowing what's coming.
1983: Holding a candle at Ninoy's funeral procession. Two million people. A nation awakening.

And then—

**FLASH—**
February 22, 1986.

Maria, now sixty years old, standing on EDSA.

Millions of people around her. Yellow everywhere. Nuns kneeling before tanks. Soldiers crying as civilians offer them flowers.

Radio Veritas crackling: *"Do not be afraid! God is with us!"*

Maria is holding a rosary in one hand. In the other—the amulet. YOUR amulet. The one you're wearing now.

She's placing something inside the EDSA shrine. A small box. Encrypted message inside.

"Para sa susunod na henerasyon," she whispers.
*(For the next generation.)*

**FLASH—**
Maria's voice, older now, tired:

"Ang lihim na pinrotektahan ng ating pamilya sa loob ng 400 taon... hindi lang ito kasaysayan. Ito ay KAPANGYARIHAN. Ang kapangyarihan na ipakita ang katotohanan—ang TUNAY na kasaysayan. Hindi ang kasaysayan na sinulat ng mga nanalo. Kundi ang kasaysayan na DINANAS ng mga tao."

*(The secret our family has protected for 400 years... it's not just history. It's POWER. The power to show truth—the REAL history. Not the history written by the victors. But the history LIVED by the people.)*

"At ngayon, apo—IKAW ang pipili kung ano ang gagawin sa kapangyarihang iyon."

*(And now, grandchild—YOU will choose what to do with that power.)*

The void opens into brilliant yellow light—

**[CHAPTER 5 BEGINS]**

# CHAPTER 5: "Ang Kapangyarihan ng Bayan" (The Power of the People)

**ERA:** EDSA Revolution, February 25, 1986

**LOCATION:** EDSA, the final hours of the revolution

**CIPHER TYPE:** Columnar Transposition Cipher (Key: 31524)

**EMOTIONAL THEME:** Unity, Choice, and Legacy

---

## SCENE 1: The Sea of Yellow

**Setting:** EDSA highway, millions of people, the climax of People Power

### Narrative:

You emerge into a WALL of sound.

Singing. Chanting. Praying. Laughing. Crying.

You're standing in the middle of EDSA highway, but it's not a highway anymore. It's a river of humanity.

MILLIONS of people stretch in every direction. Old, young, rich, poor. Nuns in habits. Students in jeans. Businessmen who've loosened their ties. Mothers with children on their hips.

Everyone is wearing yellow.

The smell hits you: sampaguita flowers, pandesal bread, candle wax, sweat, hope.

Someone hands you a yellow ribbon. Someone else offers you a piece of ensaymada. A child gives you a flower.

"Cory! Cory! Cory!" the crowd chants.

Radio Veritas blares from a hundred transistor radios:
*"The Marcoses have fled Malacañang! The helicopters have left! The dictatorship is OVER!"*

The crowd ERUPTS.

Twenty years of fear, of silence, of darkness—OVER.

People embrace strangers. Tears flow freely. Church bells ring across Manila.

And there, in the center of it all—

You see HER.

Maria. Your lola. Sixty years old. Wearing a yellow dress. Rosary in hand. Face streaked with tears of joy.

She's standing before the EDSA shrine, and she's looking directly at you.

No surprise this time. She's been waiting.

"Apo." She opens her arms. "Nandito ka na."
*(Grandchild. You're here.)*

## SCENE 2: The Final Truth

**Setting:** EDSA shrine, amidst the celebration

### Narrative:

Maria embraces you, and for a moment, you're just grandchild and grandmother. Nothing more. Nothing less.

When she pulls back, her eyes are serious.

"Malapit na tayong matapos, apo. Isang cipher na lang."
*(We're almost done, grandchild. One more cipher.)*

She leads you to the base of the shrine. A loose stone. She pulls it back, revealing a small metal box.

"I planted this thirty years ago," she says, switching to English for the first time. "Before I ever met your lolo. Before your mother was born. Before YOU were born."

"How?"

"The amulet doesn't just show the past. It allows the guardians to PREPARE the past. Each of us—every woman in our line—has traveled these same paths. Laying clues. Building the journey. For YOU."

"Why me?"

Maria's face softens. "Because I saw you, apo. In 1945, when you appeared in my guerrilla camp. I KNEW. I knew you were the one who would finally have to make the choice."

She opens the box. Inside: a folded piece of paper, yellow with age.

"Ang huling cipher. Columnar Transposition. Mas kumplikado kaysa sa iba, pero—" she smiles. "—ikaw ang nakatapos ng lahat hanggang ngayon. Kaya mo 'to."

*(The final cipher. Columnar Transposition. More complicated than the others, but—you've completed everything until now. You can do this.)*

"And after I solve it?"

"Then you'll understand the secret. And you'll choose."

She hands you the paper.

"Ang susi ay ang taon ng People Power."
*(The key is the year of People Power.)*

"1986?"

"31524." She points to the numbers. "Rearranged. Like how we rearranged this nation tonight."

Behind you, the crowd continues to celebrate. History being made. A nation reborn.

"Kapag nalaman mo na ang lihim—huwag mong sabihin sa akin. Kailangan mong magpasya nang mag-isa."

*(When you know the secret—don't tell me. You need to decide alone.)*

She kisses your forehead.

"Ipagmamalaki kita kahit ano ang piliin mo, apo. Tandaan mo yan."

*(I'll be proud of you no matter what you choose. Remember that.)*

### Interactive Elements:
- [ ] Hidden compartment reveal
- [ ] Box opening animation
- [ ] Crowd noise slightly muted for this intimate moment

## SCENE 4: The Secret Revealed

### Narrative:

The final letters arrange themselves:

**"THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE IS GREATER THAN THE PEOPLE IN POWER"**

The amulet BLAZES brighter than ever before.

And suddenly—you SEE.

Not just the message. EVERYTHING.

The amulet shows you four hundred years of guardians. Women in your bloodline. Each one passing the amulet to the next. Each one traveling through time. Each one adding to the knowledge.

You see:
- The first guardian, a babaylan in 1500s, who received the amulet from a dying datu
- A mestiza woman hiding it from Spanish friars
- Your great-great-grandmother smuggling it past American soldiers
- Maria—your lola—carrying it through WWII, Martial Law, and EDSA

And you understand the SECRET:

The amulet doesn't just show history. It RECORDS it. Every moment. Every truth. Every injustice. Every triumph.

Four hundred years of REAL Philippine history. Not the history in textbooks. Not the history written by colonizers. The history LIVED by your people.

The massacres erased from records.
The heroes whose names were forgotten.
The resistance movements that were covered up.
The truth about everything.

And the POWER:

The amulet can SHOW this truth to anyone. Project it. Make them experience it as you have. Feel it. Know it.

One activation—and the whole world would know the real history of the Philippines. Of colonization. Of resistance. Of what was lost and what survived.

Maria's voice echoes from somewhere:

"Ngayon alam mo na. Ang tanong: ANO ANG GAGAWIN MO?"
*(Now you know. The question: WHAT WILL YOU DO?)*

# EPILOGUE: "Ang Iyong Pagpili" (Your Choice)

**Setting:** Present day—your lola's ancestral house—dawn breaking

### Narrative:

The world reforms around you.

You're back. Lola's house. The baúl still open before you. Dawn light streaming through the capiz windows.

The amulet is warm in your hands. Alive with four hundred years of truth.

A figure sits in the corner of the room.

"Lola?"

She steps into the light. She's old now—the lola you've always known. White hair. Weathered hands. That familiar sampaguita scent.

But her eyes—they hold everything you've seen. Every version of her. Every era.

"Natapos mo na, apo. Nakita mo na ang lahat."
*(You've finished. You've seen everything.)*

"Lola, where were you? Why did you disappear?"

She smiles sadly. "Kailangan kong mag-travel one last time. Para i-set up ang iyong final journey. Para siguraduhing makakarating ka ng ligtas."

*(I needed to travel one last time. To set up your final journey. To make sure you'd arrive safely.)*

"The pursuers—who were they?"

"People who want to control the narrative. Who want to keep history hidden. They exist in every era. And they know about the amulet."

She walks to you, takes your hands in hers.

"But they don't matter now. What matters is YOUR choice."

She gestures to the amulet.

"You can activate its full power. Show the world the truth. Every colonization. Every erasure. Every hidden resistance. The REAL history of our people."

"Or?"

"Or you keep it hidden. Pass it to the next generation. Let them make the choice when THEY'RE ready. Maybe the world isn't ready yet. Maybe it needs more time."

She squeezes your hands.

"I can't tell you what to do, apo. Every guardian has made this choice. Some activated it. Some didn't. The world is shaped by those choices."

"What did you choose?"

Maria's eyes glisten. "Pinili kong i-pass ito sa'yo. Dahil naniniwala ako... handa ka na."

*(I chose to pass it to you. Because I believe... you're ready.)*

The amulet pulses. Waiting.

"Ang hindi marunong lumingon sa pinanggalingan ay hindi makararating sa paroroonan," Maria whispers. "But also—ang may hawak ng katotohanan ay may responsibilidad sa kinabukasan."

*(Those who don't look back won't reach their destination. But also—those who hold the truth have a responsibility to the future.)*

She steps back.

"Ikaw na ang magde-decide, apo. Anuman ang piliin mo—ipagmamalaki kita. Palagi."

*(You decide now, grandchild. Whatever you choose—I'll be proud of you. Always.)*

The room holds its breath.

The amulet glows.

**WHAT DO YOU CHOOSE?**

---

# THE CHOICE

---

## Option A: "Share the Truth"

### Narrative:

You raise the amulet.

"The world needs to know."

Maria nods, tears streaming. "Matapang ka talaga, apo."
*(You really are brave, grandchild.)*

You press the amulet to your heart.

LIGHT explodes outward.

Across the Philippines—across the WORLD—people see.

They experience what you experienced. The truth of history. The real stories. The forgotten heroes. The erased voices.

Not as text in a book. But as LIVED EXPERIENCE.

The babaylan protecting ancient knowledge.
The Katipuneros dying for freedom.
The guerrillas fighting in the mountains.
The students resisting in darkness.
The millions standing on EDSA.

Four hundred years of truth, flowing into the collective consciousness of humanity.

It will change everything.

It already has.

Maria holds your hand as the light fades.

"Ang simula pa lang ito, apo. Pero sa unang pagkakataon sa mahabang panahon... ang katotohanan ay malaya na."

*(This is only the beginning, grandchild. But for the first time in a long time... the truth is free.)*

### Ending A - THE END

**Epilogue text:**
> *"History is not written by the victors alone. It is carried by the survivors, the rememberers, the ones who refuse to forget.*
>
> *And now, it is carried by you."*

---

## Option B: "Protect and Pass On"

### Narrative:

You lower the amulet.

"Not yet. But soon."

Maria's expression holds no disappointment—only understanding.

"Matalino ka, apo. Hindi lahat ng katotohanan ay dapat ilabas agad. Minsan kailangan ng tamang panahon."

*(You're wise, grandchild. Not all truths need to come out immediately. Sometimes it needs the right time.)*

"I need to learn more first. Understand more. And maybe... train the next guardian."

Maria smiles. The same smile from 1945. From 1983. From 1986.

"Iyon ang pinili ng aking ina. At ng kanyang ina. Ang protektahan ang katotohanan hanggang sa tamang sandali. Hindi yan kahinaan, apo. Iyan ay wisdom."

*(That's what my mother chose. And her mother. To protect the truth until the right moment. That's not weakness, grandchild. That's wisdom.)*

She takes your hand.

"Pero ang responsibilidad ay sa'yo na ngayon. Ang amulet. Ang kaalaman. Ang pagpili kung kailan at kung paano ilalabas ang katotohanan."

*(But the responsibility is yours now. The amulet. The knowledge. The choice of when and how to release the truth.)*

You place the amulet around your neck. It settles against your chest, warm and alive with possibility.

"Will you teach me? Everything you know?"

Maria's eyes crinkle with joy. "Mayroon tayong habang-buhay, apo. At ngayon—mayroon ka nang access sa lahat ng panahon."

*(We have a lifetime, grandchild. And now—you have access to all time periods.)*

She takes your hand.

"Halika. Mag-almusal muna tayo. Pagkatapos... magsisimula na ang tunay na pagsasanay."

*(Come. Let's have breakfast first. After that... the real training begins.)*

You walk out into the morning light together. Grandmother and grandchild. Past and future.

The truth is safe. For now.

But one day, when the time is right—it will shine.

### Ending B - THE END

**Epilogue text:**
> *"Some secrets are meant to be kept—not hidden, but protected. Nurtured. Prepared.*
>
> *The truth is patient. It can wait.*
>
> *And when its time comes, you will be ready."*

# POST-CREDITS SCENE (Both endings)

### Narrative:

**MONTHS LATER...**

You're in your apartment, researching at your computer.

The amulet glows softly beneath your shirt.

A news notification pops up:

> **"MYSTERIOUS ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCOVERY IN MANILA BAY: Ancient artifacts suggest pre-colonial Filipino civilization was more advanced than previously believed."**

You smile.

The truth is starting to emerge. Bit by bit. With or without the amulet's full power.

Your phone buzzes. Lola's text:

> "Apo, may bisita tayo bukas. Isang historian na interesado sa ating pamilya. Handa ka na ba?"
>
> *(Grandchild, we have a visitor tomorrow. A historian interested in our family. Are you ready?)*

You type back:

> "Palagi, Lola. Para sa katotohanan—palagi akong handa."
>
> *(Always, Lola. For the truth—I'm always ready.)*

The amulet pulses once. Warm. Reassuring.

The journey continues.

# 📝 NOTES FOR DEVELOPMENT

## Key Design Decisions Made:

1. **Player meets young Lola in Chapter 3** - Creates powerful dramatic irony and emotional payoff

2. **Pursuers remain mysterious** - Keeps focus on family story rather than villain subplot

3. **Two distinct endings** - Both are valid, neither is "wrong," reflects real choices about truth-telling

4. **Maria appears in three eras** - 1945 (19), 1983 (57), 1986 (60) - shows her lifelong commitment

5. **Ciphers tied to historical context** - Each cipher choice reflects the era's communication needs

## Potential Expansions:

- **Sequel Hook**: The historian visiting at the end
- **DLC Chapters**: Other time periods (American colonial era, Japanese occupation details)
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Collaborative cipher solving
- **AR Feature**: Real-world locations in the Philippines
